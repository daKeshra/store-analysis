# Store Sales Analysis

## IntroductionÂ¶
A supermarket is a self-service shop offering a wide variety of food, beverages, and household products, organized into sections. This kind of store is larger and has a wider selection than earlier grocery stores but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market.
In everyday U.S. usage, however, "grocery store" is synonymous with supermarket, and is not used to refer to other types of stores that sell groceries.
